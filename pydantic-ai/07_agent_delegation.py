In this example, we explore Pydantic AI with the following features:
- Multi-Agent Applications patterns
- One agent delegating work to another agent via tools
- Parent agent calls child agent, then takes back control when finished
- Passing ctx.usage to track combined usage across multiple agents

"Agent delegation" refers to the scenario where an agent delegates work 
to another agent, then takes back control when the delegate agent 
(the agent called from within a tool) finishes.
