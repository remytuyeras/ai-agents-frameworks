"""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we explore Pydantic AI with the following features:
- Human-in-the-loop tool approval
- Two approval patterns: requires_approval=True and ApprovalRequired exception
- DeferredToolRequests output pausing agent execution for approval
- DeferredToolResults providing approval or denial decisions
- Continuing agent execution with message history after approval

Human-in-the-loop approval enables safe execution of sensitive operations by requiring
explicit human authorization. Tools can conditionally or always require approval,
and the agent pauses execution until receiving approval decisions for each tool call.
